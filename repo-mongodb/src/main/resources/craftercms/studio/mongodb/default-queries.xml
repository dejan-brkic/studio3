        This File contains default CrafterCms MongoDBQueries.
        If you want to override any of this queries use custom-queries.properties file located
        classpath:craftercms/extension/studio/mongodb/custom-queries.properties
        IF USE CDATA is use DO NOT add any new line, JSON parser WILL BREAK.
